Abstract 
Decision trees have been widely used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks based on its tree-like structure that represents a series of decisions and their possible consequences. In order to improve the accuracy of decision trees, researchers have proposed a new method called Ant Colony Decision Trees (ACDT), based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The ACO is a metaheuristic inspired by the foraging behavior of real ants, where they search for the shortest path between their nest and food sources by considering both local heuristic and previous knowledge, observed by pheromone changes. This article will start with a basic definition of a decision tree and then expand to the more complex ACDT, including its background and detailed explanations of the algorithm.
